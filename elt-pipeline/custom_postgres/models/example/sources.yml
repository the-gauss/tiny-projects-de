# sources.yml includes external/raw data sources that dbt will reference (e.g. what our ELT script loads into the destination Postgres database). dbt does not "create" these sources; they are expected to already exist in the database.
sources:
  - name: destination_db
    description: "Raw data from the destination PostgreSQL database."
    database: "{{ env_var('DEST_DB_NAME') }}"
    schema: public
    tables:
      - name: films
        description: "List of films."
      - name: actors
        description: "List of actors."
      - name: film_actors
        description: "Mapping between films and actors."
